V0.2
- Added flexibility in how connections are listed. No longer unique names for each list required
- Retooled package to be centered around the "network" object, which contains all the information needed and sub functions required to
  build, simulate, and produce output.
- Folder structure not important anymore (all YML files one level within experiment folder will be found i.e. myNetwork/ymlfiles/... & myNetwork/ymlfiles/connsV1)
- Added possibility of listing more source and target areas to increase efficiency (i.e. need equal number in each list, one-to-one relationship, see doc)
- Fixed proper output path naming

V0.1
- Initial release

TODO:
# Implement print from text field functions (canceled for now)
# Implement progress bar functions (done)
# ^ for other areas not just simulation
# Add informative prints to user
# Add error log, even if things run just fine
# Implement data output and storage to mat file functions (DONE)
# Expand to multiple file formats
# Implement graphical output functions
    # Rasters DONE
    # Average currents DONE
    # Movies
    # Firing rates
    # More
# Implement results to pdf functions
# Implement specific checks:
    # Simulation times multiple of resolution, (x/steps*100)/resolution = INTEGER
# Make a network object with everything, and that has all the functions - DONE
    # Including a run all function - DONE
# Documentation
# Fix "discard" option on sim_states instead
# Optional receptor type specification in neurons - DONE
    # Fix so that you can change multiple synapse parameters - DONE
# Fix 2D and 3D output formats
# Date format for output
# Fix a better output system
# Multiple outputs with parameter lists
# Possibility to iterate over stuff
# Fix better progress output
# Discard not working
# Save one file per recorder - DONE
# Fix that output thing - DONE
# Make it more memory efficient in outpus - DONE
# Move "name" from outputs to states
# Possibility to record synapse weights
# Fix so that layers can also be more generally generated
# Look into free layers (or even free 3d layers)
# Look into rules like "20% of thalamic cells are matrix cells with specific connectivity"

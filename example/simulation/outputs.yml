---                           ### Every YAML file starts with this
simulation:                   ### This is the main structure for all things "simulation"
    output:                   ### This is the substructure for all things "output"
        data:                 ### Specifically for data to be used later, i.e. data storing
          reset: True         ### True = reset NEST engine after simulation (remove temp data)
          save:               ### Here we specify data storing options
              name: test      ### Here you specify a name for the particular run you want to simulate
              style: [2D,3D]  ### Data format, i.e. two dimensional (neurons by time) or three (neurons by neurons by time)
              formats: [".mat"] ### Output format ".mat" = MatLab, ".pickle" = pickled data, ".pf" = pandas dataframe
        graphical: ["raster","mean_currents"] ### Graphical output formats
...                           ### Every YAML file ends with this

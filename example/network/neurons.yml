  trash: &anchor              ### Elements in "trash" will be thrown. "&anchor" means that when you use "*anchor" you inherit everything one level inside.
    type: iaf_psc_alpha       ### Here we specify a model type to be used as a base. It must exist in NEST.
    parameters:               ### Here we specify parameters to update the model type's default values, by using key-value pairs.
      tau_m: 16.0             ### Here we set a specific key-value pair. The key-value must be in the same format as that in the original model type.

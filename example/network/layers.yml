---                           ### Every YAML file starts with this
network:                      ### This is the main structure of all things "network"
  trash: &anchor              ### Elements in "trash" will be thrown. "&anchor" means that when you use "*anchor" you inherit everything one level inside.
      model1_std: &m1s        ### Here we specify a specific anchor for use later
        rows: 30              ### Here we specify the number of rows in our layer
        columns: 30           ### Here we specify the number of columns in our layer
        extent: [30.0,30.0]   ### Here we give a list of the number of nodes to fit vertically and horizontally in our layer.
        edge_wrap: True       ### Here we specify that the layer should connect on all sides with itself, i.e. loop around.

      model2_std: &m2s        ### Here we designate another anchor for use later
        rows: 30
        columns: 30
        extent:               ### This is another way to make a list
            - 30.0            ### A list entry
            - 30.0
        edge_wrap: True

  layers:                     ### And here come the layers
      -                       ### A list entry
        parameters:           ### Parameters for our layer
            <<: *m1s          ### Here we inherit from above
            elements: [Retina] ### Here we specify the elements, aka. the neurons we want in our layer
        name: Retina_layer    ### Here we name the layer so it can be found later.

        parameters:
